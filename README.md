## **About the Project**

- The trees are created with an L-System algorithm
- The creatures are generated with a genetic algorithm

---

## **How to Use**

- Setup the terrain (select the "Terrain" in the Hierarchy, change the "Terrain Noise Generation" settings in the Inspector)
- Start the scene ("play" button)
- Use the camera controls to move within the scene (see details below)
- Generate the props ("propspulate" button -> you can click on this button as many times as you would like until you are satisfied with the result)
- Generate the population ("populate" button -> you should only click this button once, if you would like to generate a new population, you should stop the scene and start it again using the "play" button)

## **Camera Controls** (when the scene is in "play" mode)

- **Camera Movement**: Use the **W**, **A**, **S**, **D** keys to move forward, left, backward, and right, respectively. (Note: Use **Z**, **Q**, **S**, **D** on an AZERTY keyboard)
- **Camera Rotation**: Move the mouse to rotate the camera.
- **Vertical Look**: Mouse movement controls up-and-down view angles, clamped to 90 degrees.
- **Movement Speed**:
    - Use the mouse scroll wheel to adjust movement speed dynamically.
    - Press the middle mouse button to reset speed to default.
- **Toggle Camera Control**: Right-click to toggle camera controls on or off.
    - When off, the cursor is unlocked for UI interaction or other uses.
- **Stop Movement**: Movement halts when camera control is disabled.
